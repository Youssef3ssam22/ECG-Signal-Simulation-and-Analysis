# ECG-Signal-Simulation-and-Analysis
# Real-Time ECG Signal Simulation and Analysis

This project simulates and analyzes ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals using Python. It was developed as part of the *Biomedical Data Acquisition* course (BMD351 - Fall 2024) at Galala University.

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Simulate ECG signals using NeuroKit2.
- Filter noise from the signal using a Butterworth bandpass filter.
- Detect R-peaks and calculate the heart rate.
- Visualize the ECG signal and results.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries
- **Python**
- **NeuroKit2** – ECG simulation and processing
- **SciPy** – Butterworth filtering
- **Matplotlib** – Plotting
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations

## 📈 Features
- 10-second ECG simulation at 500 Hz
- Bandpass filtering (0.5–50 Hz)
- R-peak detection
- Heart rate calculation and visualization
- Average heart rate output

## 💡 Potential Applications
- Real-time patient monitoring systems
- Wearable ECG device development
- Biomedical research and signal analysis

## 🔬 Future Improvements
- Integrate with hardware for live ECG analysis
- Add heart rate variability (HRV) calculations
- Improve noise robustness with wavelet transforms

## 📸 Sample Output

*Add screenshots of the plots from your code here (Filtered ECG, R-peaks, etc.)*
